# Heart_Disease_Prediction_WebApp
Hello  Everyone !
Here I present you all one of my projects above Heart Disease prediction Web Application. This was my final year project. I contributed to the project by designing the Web part using python and one of its framework i.e. Django ,while my peers handled the Machine learning part.
From here, I will guide you how to get this project going.I have uploaded all the necessary files relating to the project. 
In the ipynb file you can get the ML code for the project.
Again the Dj_ML Model file has the Django code used to integrate the project with WebApp.
Coming to the running of the project ,you need to follow these steps.
a)open the heartpredict folder on your VS code/any IDE
b)get into the myheart directory,you will find "manage.py" file.
c)open your terminal in this directory and type 
python manage.py runserver
d)make sure you have django installed on your system
e)after this runserver command You will see a link generated in your terminal
f)get to the link and you are in.
g)Fill the parameters and you are one step closer to know whether you are at a risk of heart disease.
THANK YOU ! Hope this helps..
